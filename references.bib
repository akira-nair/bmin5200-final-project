	abstract = {Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.},

	abstract = {Anti-cytokine autoantibodies (ACAAs) are increasingly recognized as modulating disease severity in infection, inflammation and autoimmunity. By reducing or augmenting cytokine signalling pathways or by altering the half-life of cytokines in the circulation, ACAAs can be either pathogenic or disease ameliorating. The origins of ACAAs remain unclear. Here, we focus on the most common ACAAs in the context of disease groups with similar characteristics. We review the emerging genetic and environmental factors that are thought to drive their production. We also describe how the profiling of ACAAs should be considered for the early diagnosis, active monitoring,~treatment or sub-phenotyping of diseases. Finally, we discuss how understanding the biology of naturally occurring ACAAs can guide therapeutic strategies.},

	doi = {10.1093/rheumatology/keab003},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ability to identify lupus patients in high disease activity status (HDAS) without knowledge of the SLEDAI could have application in selection of patients for treatment escalation or enrolment in trials. We sought to generate an algorithm that could calculate via model fitting the presence of HDAS using simple demographic and laboratory values.
METHODS: We examined the association of high disease activity (HDA) with demographic and laboratory parameters using prospectively collected data. An HDA visit is recorded when SLEDAI-2K >=10. We utilized the use of combinatorial search to find algorithms to build a mathematical model predictive of HDA. Performance of each algorithm was evaluated using multi-class area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the final model was compared with the na{\"i}ve Bayes classifier, and analysed using the confusion matrix for accuracy and misclassification rate.
RESULTS: Data on 286 patients, followed for a median of 5.1 years were studied for a total of 5680 visits. Sixteen laboratory parameters were found to be significantly associated with HDA. A total of 216 algorithms were evaluated and the final algorithm chosen was based on seven pathology measures and three demographic variables. It has an accuracy of 88.6\% and misclassification rate of 11.4\%. When compared with the na{\"i}ve Bayes classifier [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.663], our algorithm has a better accuracy with AUC = 0.829.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that building an accurate model to calculate HDA using routinely available clinical parameters is feasible. Future studies to independently validate the algorithm will be needed to confirm its predictive performance.},

	abstract = {Objective Use of the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) in routine clinical practice is inconsistent, and availability of clinician-recorded SLEDAI scores in real-world datasets is limited. This study aimed to validate a machine learning model to estimate SLEDAI score categories using clinical notes and to apply the model to a large, real-world dataset to generate estimated score categories for use in future research studies.Methods A machine learning model was developed to estimate an individual patient{\textquoteright}s SLEDAI score category (no activity, mild activity, moderate activity or high/very high activity) for a specific encounter date using clinical notes. A training cohort of 3504 encounters and a separate validation cohort of 1576 encounters were created from the OM1 SLE Registry. Model performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calculated using a binarised version of the outcome that sets the positive class to be those records with clinician-recorded SLEDAI scores {\textgreater}5 and the negative class to be records with scores <=5. Model performance was evaluated by categorising the scores into the four disease activity categories and by calculating the Spearman{\textquoteright}s R value and Pearson{\textquoteright}s R value.Results The AUC for the two categories was 0.93 for the development cohort and 0.91 for the validation cohort. The model had a Spearman{\textquoteright}s R value of 0.7 and a Pearson{\textquoteright}s R value of 0.7 when calculated using the four disease activity categories.Conclusion The model performs well when estimating SLEDAI score categories using unstructured clinical notes.},

	abstract = {Background: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic disease characterized by a broad spectrum of involved organs, including neurological, renal, and vascular domains, with disease activity manifesting through unpredictable patterns that vary across individuals and over time, making the prediction of activity events particularly challenging.
Objective: This paper proposes a hierarchical machine learning model to predict a 12-month SLE activity, defined as the occurrence of at least one event among SLE hospitalization, new organ-involved domain, and neurological, renal, or vascular manifestation within the following year. At each patient{\textquoteright}s visit, the model considers all the features at the current time point, the information about the patient{\textquoteright}s clinical history, and about its last 12 months, to predict the outcome for the next 12 months.
Methods: The study cohort consists of 262 patients with at least an outpatient visit and an SLE admission from 2012 to 2020, at the Italian Gemelli Hospital, comprising a retrospective longitudinal dataset of 5962 contacts. The data include demographics, laboratory, clinical features (eg, domain involvements and manifestations), treatments, and pathways (eg, contact types as outpatients, hospitalizations, day hospitals, and visit frequency). The variables consider 3 time ranges: features about the current contact and the last 12 months, and the previous patient{\textquoteright}s clinical history. The main model was developed by testing different machine learning approaches within a cross-validation setup. The predicted probability outputs were used in a risk stratification analysis, identifying 3 groups of predictions: strong, moderate, and mild. Mild samples were then passed through a second cascade model. The integration of the main model (applied to strong and moderate samples) with the cascade model (applied to mild contacts) forms our final hierarchical model.
Results: The hierarchical model, resulting from the ensemble of the main random forest and cascade decision tree, demonstrated enhanced performance, increasing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.696 (95\% CI 0.672-0.719) in the original main model to 0.743 (95\% CI 0.717-0.769), particularly for specific patient characteristics. Through the application of explainable artificial intelligence methods, we also identified the key features that significantly influence the model{\textquoteright}s predictions. Among the 185 collected features, 15 emerged as the most impactful, including age at contact, response to therapy modifications, abnormal laboratory tests, and clinical manifestations. This analysis plays a crucial role in enhancing model transparency, which is essential for fostering the adoption of artificial intelligence in health care settings.
Conclusions: Our study introduces an explainable and reliable tool for predicting 1-year SLE activity, supporting physicians with an advanced decision-support system to improve patient management. The model identifies key features that may help characterize patient phenotypes, enabling personalized treatment plans and better outcomes. In addition, the methodology can be generalized for predictive analytics in other chronic autoimmune diseases.},
